This notebook explores a plane dataset to see if we can extract abnormal functionning.


# Detection of Abnormal Aircraft Window Measurements
This project aims to build an algorithm to detect abnormal window measurements in aircraft systems. The system records parameters such as speed, temperature, pressure, and electrical current values, and a window is defined as a section of up to 100 measurements.

# Data Exploration
We started by exploring the data to gain a better understanding of it. We used histograms and heatmaps to visualize the distributions of the different parameters and their correlations.

# Windows and Measures
We then formulated the problem and developed an approach to detect abnormal window measurements. We presented our findings and commented on the results.

# Extreme Window Values
We also studied the extreme values in the windows and compared them with the Isolation Forest algorithm. We presented the results and commented on the differences.

# Outlier Validation with PCA and Clustering
We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering to validate the outlier values in the windows. We presented the results and commented on their relevance.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, we built an algorithm to detect abnormal window measurements in aircraft systems using an approach based on extreme values and PCA. We presented our findings and commented on the results. This project can be used to detect abnormal windows in other datasets of aircraft systems.
